# Project 1 
# HR-Dashboard
Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub profile as my first project! I'm really into analyzing data, especially when it comes to HR (Human Resources). I create cool dashboards using tools like Power Query and Power BI.

In one of my projects, I used Power Query to clean up HR data and make it easier to analyze. Then, I loaded it into Power BI to create awesome reports and dashboards. It's all about turning raw data into useful insights!

I even made a video tutorial on creating an HR analytic dashboard using an Excel file. With Power Query, I showed how to make the data clean and ready for analysis. And with Power BI, I made interactive reports and dashboards that look super cool.

If you're interested in HR analytics or want to learn more about Power Query and Power BI, check out my GitHub. You'll find projects, tutorials, and other resources that show how I turn HR data into awesome visualizations.

Got any questions or want to collaborate? Feel free to reach out to me. Let's unlock the secrets hidden in HR data together and make better decisions!

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub profile, and stay tuned for more exciting projects!
